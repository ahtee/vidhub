VidHub is a video sharing website.

## App Screenshots

Coming soon!

## Getting started

VidHub is built with React on the front-end. Backend is still to-be-developed. Feel free to contribute or offer suggestions on how to improve the platform.

Clone the repo to your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/ahtee/vidhub.git
```

### Running locally

Change to your cloned directory `cd vidhub`

Install the dependencies with yarn or npm
```
npm install

yarn install
```

Start the development server:
```
npm start

yarn start
```

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Wishlist

Check the projects tab for features yet to be created. All features on the site need backend hooks.
